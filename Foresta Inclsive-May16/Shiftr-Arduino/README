The files that I am currently using are:

All Ethernet Arduino sketches - we are still working on setting up wifi
1) shiftr-receive-3sensor-values - this is on the arduino in studio. It receives the 3 sensor values from the outdoor arduino. This one also sends the wet-soil threshhold values to the arduino outside.

2) Siftr-send-3sensor-value-ethernet - this is the sketch that is outdoors and connected to the solar panel. THis on sends the wetsoil, soiltemp, and light values.
